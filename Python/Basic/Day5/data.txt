An empty street
An empty house
A hole inside my heart
I'm all alone
The rooms are getting smaller
I wonder how
I wonder why
I wonder where they are
The days we had
The songs we sang together
And all my love
I'm holding on forever
Reaching for the love that seems so far
So I say a little prayer
And hope my dreams will take me there
Where the skies are blue
To see you once again, my love
Over seas from coast to coast
To find the place I love the most
Where the fields are green
To see you once again, my love
I tried to read
I go to work
I'm laughing with my friends
But I can't stop
To keep myself from hinking
I wonder how
I wonder why
I wonder where they are
The days we had
The songs we sang together
And all my love
I'm holding on forever
